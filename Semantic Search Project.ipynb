    "# *Semantic Search Query Model*\n",
    "## Cailean Bushnell \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a semantic search system that enhances the relevance of database query results, enabling ASPIRE customers to more effectively locate desired content.\n",
    "\n",
    "After considerable research and experimentation, we determined that integrating a pre-trained semantic model into our user interface would be the most feasible approach. Existing off-the-shelf search indexes were either incompatible with our database structure or exceeded our computational constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Retrieve & Re-Rank Model*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected the `multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1` model, which is optimized for semantic search and available via HuggingFace. This model is capable of identifying relevant documents, passages, or articles based on a user-provided query. It was trained on 215 million (question, answer) pairs sourced from platforms such as Bing, Google Search, and Quora. The model supports a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens and utilizes mean pooling for embedding generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieve-and-re-rank architecture substantially improves semantic search performance by enabling a two-stage filtering process: initial retrieval of potentially relevant articles, followed by refined ranking. This framework is particularly effective for addressing complex or ambiguous queries, allowing the system to surface the most contextually appropriate ASPIRE articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantic search process proceeds through the following pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Input:** The user enters a search query.\n",
    "2. **Bi-Encoder Retrieval:** The query is encoded and passed through the bi-encoder, which searches the document corpus and retrieves the top 10 semantically relevant articles.\n",
    "3. **Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking:** The retrieved articles are then passed through the cross-encoder, which re-ranks them based on a deeper semantic comparison with the original query.\n",
    "4. **Output:** A ranked list of results is returned and presented to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Technical Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our retrieval system combines both lexical and vector-based search techniques. Lexical search captures exact textual matches but fails to account for synonyms, acronyms, or spelling variations. To overcome these limitations, we use a bi-encoder to transform both queries and articles into dense vector representations, enabling more flexible and context-aware retrieval via similarity measures such as dot product, cosine similarity, or Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although tools like ElasticSearch and Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms can also be used for dense vector retrieval, we opted for a bi-encoder due to its simplicity and effectiveness within our project timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "While bi-encoders are efficient and scalable, they may occasionally return irrelevant results. To address this, we incorporated a cross-encoder for fine-grained semantic evaluation. Specifically, we utilized the `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` model, which jointly processes the query and each candidate article through a transformer network and outputs a relevance score between 0 and 1. This mechanism significantly improves performance, especially when dealing with domains not explicitly represented during the bi-encoder’s training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, our implementation does not involve fine-tuning. We concluded that the model's pre-training on a broad range of data was sufficient given the nature of our corpus. Additionally, the absence of clearly defined \"correct\" answers for user queries made supervised fine-tuning infeasible within our timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Part 1: Installing Dependencies and Preprocessing Data*\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our search model, we compiled a CSV file containing scraped articles from investment-related websites. These articles serve as our test corpus for determining the relevance of returned results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step involves installing the required dependencies and converting the scraped content into a structured DataFrame.\n"

    "\n",
    "To evaluate the model's effectiveness in our target use case, we compiled a dataset of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 articles scraped from ASPIRE investor websites. These articles were consolidated into a CSV file and preprocessed into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both the bi-encoder and cross-encoder were pre-trained on external datasets, we incorporated a lexical (keyword-based) search component to complement the semantic retrieval process. The lexical search serves as an initial filter to ensure that results contain explicit keyword matches relevant to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach—combining keyword filtering with semantic re-ranking—improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the retrieval pipeline. It allows us to discard obviously irrelevant articles early in the process, reducing computational overhead and enhancing the responsiveness of the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "By narrowing the search space before semantic re-ranking, we ensure that the final output not only captures contextual meaning but also preserves literal relevance, thereby increasing user satisfaction and improving the overall usability of the ASPIRE query system."

The reservoir will remain down until mid-November. When the work is completed, the reservoir will be refilled to normal elevation.\" \"BENSON, Cache County, Utah — Operators of the Cutler hydroelectric project will lower the reservoir beginning Oct. 25, to conduct a series of technical studies associated with the process to renew the federal license for the project. The reservoir will remain down until mid-November. When the work is completed, the reservoir will be refilled to normal elevation.\\n\\n“The studies required as part of the federal license renewal are essential to keep the Cutler project available to supply energy to customers, and to maintain the many recreational and wildlife benefits that are available from this project,” said Eve Davies, principal scientist for PacifiCorp, which owns and operates the plant. PacifiCorp, through its operating division, Rocky Mountain Power, provides electric service to 1 million customers in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming.\\n\\nOnce the drawdown begins, it is likely that access to all Cutler boat ramps will be restricted, and access to the Upper Bear River site will be eliminated during portions of the drawdown, Davies said.\\n\\n“We recognize the inconvenience this may cause to those who use Cutler reservoir this time of year,” Davies said. “We appreciate the patience of those who use our facilities while we complete these required studies. We urge any who may visit Cutler during this time to please be observant to new hazards that may become exposed. Areas that are usually accessible may become inaccessible, potentially over a period of hours, particularly during the initial period of the drawdown.”\\n\\nThe company will use the opportunity of this drawdown to perform some needed maintenance of the hydroelectric plant during the time the technical studies are being conducted.\\n\\n“Certain maintenance work can only be performed when the water is taken out of the generation works,” Davies said. “Doing this maintenance now will be a more efficient use of this drawdown and will ultimately have less impact on recreational activities and wildlife.”\\n\\nUpdates to the project schedule can be found at the Cutler website or by calling 801-220-2245.\\n\\nPacifiCorp began the six-year process to renew its federal license for the Cutler hydroelectric project in 2018. The current license expires in 2024. Stakeholders, adjacent land owners and the general public have attended public meetings conducted by either the company or by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. State agencies, stakeholders and the general public have been involved throughout the process.\\n\\nThe Cutler project first began producing power in 1927. Cutler generates about 106,000 megawatt hours of electricity annually. That is enough power to meet the typical needs of about 12,000 typical homes in Utah.\\n\\nThe project is designed for both irrigation and hydropower. The 109 foot-high Cutler Dam forms a 5,500 acre reservoir on the Bear River in Cache Valley, Utah, which is also a recreation area. The area surrounding the reservoir is mostly agricultural land. The Cutler project license was last renewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 1994 for a term of 30 years. The current license and related documents can be viewed at pacificorp.com/cutler.\"\n",
      "\t-9.501\tNACFE Releases Report on Regional Trucking Operations   \" \\n\\nThe North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE) released its latest report, More Regional Haul: An Opportunity for Trucking?\\n\\n“If you ask most people to define trucking words like ‘over the road’ and ‘long haul’ are likely to be part of the description. But the reality is that 45% of the class 8 tractors produced today are day cabs, and a high percentage of those trucks are involved in regional haul operations,” says Rick Mihelic, NACFE’s director of future technologies and study team manager.\\n\\nNACFE believes that a number of forces have come together that have the potential to lead to a more regional movement of goods. Those factors include:\\n\\nDriver hiring and retention\\nGrowth in e-commerce\\nThe push towards immediate delivery\\nGrowth in GPS based asset tracking systems (tractor, trailer, load and driver)\\nAdvances in technologies such as electric and hybrid vehicles\\nVehicle automation\\nInnovations in load matching systems\\nIncreased use of long combination vehicles\\nData collection and mining\\nVehicle specialization\\n\\nThe new report takes an in-depth look at each of these developments and also provides examples of the various types of regional haul applications.\\n\\nThe two biggest takeaways from the report revolve around drivers and alternate fueled vehicles. “Regional operations means drivers are more likely to get home on a regular basis and that could help the industry with its the driver recruitment and retention problem,” says Mike Roeth, NACFE executive director.\\n\\n“Regional operations are also fertile ground for alternate fueled vehicles because by their very nature they make it easier for fueling infrastructure for vehicles that use an energy source other than gasoline or diesel fuel to be installed,” Roeth says.\\n\\nNACFE plans to continue to watch developments in the regional haul space and is planning a fuel economy demonstration for regional fleets this fall. Run on Less Regional is being modeled after NACFE’s successful Run on Less 2017 event in which seven fleets demonstrated that 10.1 MPG was possible with real trucks delivering real freight in long haul applications. NACFE is in the process of accepting applications for fleets to participate in Run on Less Regional so it can help define what it means to be the best of the best in this growing area of trucking.\\n\\nFor media enquiries, please contact Denise Rondini: denise.rondini@nacfe.org.\"\n",

Department of Transportation officially opened the Rodanthe ‘Jug Handle’ Bridge to traffic today. The first southbound vehicles began moving across the structure at 11:40 a.m. on July 28. Northbound lanes were opened at 12:20 p.m. \\n\\nThe new 2.4-mile bridge extends over Pamlico Sound between the southern end of the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge and the village of Rodanthe, bypassing a section of N.C. 12 that is extremely vulnerable to ocean overwash. Construction of the $155 million project began in July of 2018.\\n\\n\\nIntermittent daytime lane closures on the bridge will still be necessary in the coming weeks, as Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative continues to connect electric, phone and internet transmission lines onto the new structure.\\n\\n\\nAfter the cables are attached, pavement and sandbags on the bypassed section of N.C. 12 will be removed, allowing it to return to its natural state. The road removal project is expected to be complete by the end of November.\\n\\n\\nThe Rodanthe bridge is the third new bridge to be completed on N.C. 12 in the last five years. The Captain Richard Etheridge Bridge over New Inlet was completed in 2017, and the Marc Basnight Bridge over Oregon Inlet opened in 2019.\\n\"\n",

      "\t5.823\tNikola One Truck Achieves Zero Emissions \"\\nSALT LAKE CITY, UT August 1, 2016 -- Nikola (pronounced Neek-oh-la) Motor Company’s advanced R&D team has achieved 100% zero emissions on the Nikola One commercial class 8 truck.\\n\\n\"\"While other companies have recently announced battery-powered semi-trucks, those trucks are restricted to a range of only a couple hundred miles and four to eight hours of charging between stops,” said Founder and CEO Trevor Milton. “Nikola has engineered the holy grail of the trucking industry. We are not aware of any zero emission truck in the world that can haul 80,000 pounds more than 1,000 miles and do it without stopping. The Nikola One requires only 15 minutes of downtime before heading out for the next 1,000 miles.”\\n\\n“Imagine what this could do for the air in every city in America. We knew our emissions would be low, but to have the ability to achieve true zero emissions is revolutionary for the worldwide trucking industry,” Milton added.\\n\\nWhen asked why no one had accomplished this before, Milton said, “It requires a specific zero emission refinement process of fuel and gutsy engineering and product execution. A traditional manufacturer would have to partner with an oil company, environmental group, electric vehicle engineering firm, a broad spectrum of suppliers and a world-class consulting firm to have figured it out. At Nikola, all of our development and talent is under one roof,” said Milton.\\n\\nIn addition to the zero emission semi-truck, Nikola has initiated the first steps to manufacture emission-free power plants that range from 50 kilowatts to 50 megawatts, cutting power generation costs in half. Nikola believes this technology not only has the ability to transform America’s roadways, but how the world will migrate towards zero-emission energy going forward.\\n\\nTwo months ago, Nikola announced more than $2.3 billion in reservations, totaling more than 7,000 truck reservations with deposits.\\n\\nThe Nikola One truck leasing program costs $4000 to $5000 per month, depending on which truck configuration and options the customer chooses. The first million miles of fuel under the lease is included with each truck sale, potentially offsetting 100% of the monthly cost. An average diesel burns approximately $400,000 in fuel and can rack up over $100,000 in maintenance costs over 1,000,000 miles. These costs are eliminated with the Nikola One lease. Now companies can have a zero emission truck with a return on their investment in the first month.\\n\\nFor complete product details on the Nikola One, visit www.nikolamotor.com.\\n\\nDecember 2, 2016 Event\\nWorking media representatives will receive invitations to the launch event from Robar PR, crobar@robarpr.com, no later than August 8.\\n\\nABOUT NIKOLA MOTOR COMPANY\\nNikola Motor Company designs and manufactures electric vehicles, vehicle components, energy storage systems, and electric vehicle drivetrains.

      "\t0.536\tHow Electric Vehicles are Disrupting the Grid - Kiewit News Room \"Whether it be cruising down the highway or parked at the grocery store, electric vehicles are becoming a common sight in and around urban areas in the U.S. Based on consumer demand and government mandates related to emissions reduction, electric vehicles for everyday transportation are increasingly gaining market share from fossil fueled vehicles.\\n\\nThe most notable barrier to increasing market share is “range anxiety.” U.S. drivers are accustomed to finding frequent gas fueling stations along both urban streets and rural routes. However, with a typical range of 200 miles per charge , nearly all urban electric vehicle (EV) drivers would have adequate energy for their daily driving needs with nightly charging at home. In addition, the deployment of urban charging stations at offices, parking garages, business and filling stations will further alleviate range anxiety. For rural and interstate routes, additional charging stations will be required to enable long distance travel. As this demand becomes a reality, consumers should expect to see electric fueling stations with multiple high-voltage charging stations that can fully charge a vehicle in about 30 minutes.\\n\\nTo realize the benefits of convenient EV transportation, we will have to meet the new demand these charging stations will introduce to the power grid. For example, a fast charging electric fueling station serving twenty cars simultaneously would draw approximately 2 MW, or enough to power 1,000 homes.3 Sustaining this new demand in addition to traditional power needs like air conditioners, refrigerators and lighting will stress the existing and largely antiquated distribution network.\\n\\nEncountering the EV challenge is just one example of why utilities are rapidly investing to modernize the distribution network with a focus on reliability. These current and planned investments well exceed those in the transmission market as preparations are underway for the convergence of increased need for distributed energy resources, smart infrastructure upgrades and electric vehicle charging.\\n\\nKiewit is serving the electric vehicle charging station infrastructure market through a unique partnership with LilyPad EV. This alliance melds Kiewit’s heritage of design and construction that dates back over 100 years and LilyPad EV’s hands-on experience deploying over 2,500 charging stations across the U.S. The duo will serve as a full solution provider offering planning, engineering, construction, procurement and installation of charging station ports for cities, electric utility companies, private fleets, and interstate corridors.\\n\\nAbout the authors:\\n\\nWith more than 20 years of experience in the power industry, Jon Gribble leads Kiewit’s Power Delivery group.

      "\t0.445\tAn electrifying future: Idaho National Laboratory’s role in White House efforts to make vehicle charging more accessible - INL \"INL News Release\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\nFeb. 22, 2023 \\n\\nNEWS MEDIA CONTACTS:\\nMichelle Goff, (208) 932-6581, Michelle.Goff@inl.gov\\nSarah Neumann, (208) 520-1651, sarah.neumann@inl.gov \\n\\nThe White House recently announced a plan to respond to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s call to make electric vehicle charging more accessible.   \\n\\nExperts across the federal government have identified charging as one of the biggest challenges to meet growing transportation electrification demand. New recommendations provided by the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation ensure that, as electric vehicle charging infrastructure is deployed nationwide, it will be safe and accessible.   \\n\\nIdaho National Laboratory’s John Smart, Jean Chu and Torrey Lyons served on the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation team that made these standards for safety and accessibility possible.   \\n\\nINL was asked to participate because of its vast expertise in both charging cybersecurity and charger siting. Over the past 20 years, the lab has collected extensive data on how to make EV chargers more reliable. This data has proven invaluable as the joint office works to deploy these minimum standards and requirements.  \\n\\n“This is the first time the federal government has established a national standard for electric vehicle charging infrastructure,” Smart said. “The joint office team pooled our technical expertise to help Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) establish regulations we perceive as necessary to help the industry grow and achieve a national charging network that is convenient, affordable, reliable and equitable. We also worked to ensure that these standards do not stifle innovation.”  \\n\\n“As we work with states to plan and implement a national charging network, we kept the principles of equity and environmental justice in mind,” said Lyons. “As evidenced by the Justice40 Initiative, a key Biden administration goal is to ensure that the benefits of the national charging network are enjoyed by those who have been historically left behind by the transportation system.”  \\n\\nIn addition to these minimum standards and requirements, the joint office worked with FHWA to issue another significant deliverable this week. This second effort provides clarification on how Buy America requirements apply to charging stations funded by the Department of Transportation. The document released by FHWA indicates that by July 2024, at least 55% of the contents needed to assemble new vehicle chargers must be manufactured in the United States.   \\n\\n“This guidance document will drive billions of dollars in investment throughout the nation,” Chu said. “Ideally, it will facilitate development of a domestic supply chain for electric vehicle charging equipment, positioning the United States as a continued leader in the world’s transition to electric transportation.”  \\n\\n“Serving on the joint office team has been a very rewarding experience,” said Smart. “Although we all come from different organizations and backgrounds, we have banded together as a single team for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We are thrilled to work with federal and state government agencies and the private sector to establish a national charging network that will make it possible for everyone to ride and drive electric.” \\n\\nAbout Idaho National Laboratory\\nBattelle Energy Alliance manages INL for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy.

      "\t0.423\tHow WiTricity Makes Charging Electric Cars Easier • WiTricity \"If you have an EV, you probably already count the experience of charging as the key drawback to what is otherwise a great car. And if you don’t own an EV, the hassle of charging may well be a key reason that is holding you back. Charging with a cord or cable is inconvenient – they can be heavy and bulky, trip hazards, vandalized, and located in sketchy or out-of-the-way places where you really don’t want to get out of the car. And that’s before you add arms full of kids or backpacks, rainy weather, or snowbanks. WiTricity makes charging electric cars easier: simply park and charge™.\\n\\nCharging Electric: The Evolution of Wireless Charging for EVs\\n\\nMany people are familiar with the idea of charging devices without wires from their experiences with things like electric toothbrushes, wireless headphones, and smartphones themselves. But wireless charging for electric vehicles uses a different technology with the key difference: WiTricity’s solution enables the transfer of power over distance. In other words, unlike your phone that needs to be in contact with the charging pad, and exactly aligned, EVs can charge with the WiTricity Halo® charging just by parking over it – across the air gap. And it does so just as quickly as the plug,\\n\\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge an Electric Car?\\n\\nThe length of time to charge an electric vehicle varies widely depending on a variety of factors, but the biggest variability depends on the type of charger being used. There are three key types of charging in use today.\\n\\nLevel 1 charging refers to the charger that comes with almost every electric vehicle. Also known as a “trickle” charger, it uses an ordinary 120-volt household outlet and adds between 3-5 miles of range per hour. If your car is routinely plugged in overnight, and your average travel per day is limited, this might be sufficient.\\nLevel 2 charging, significantly faster than Level 1 charging, is the most commonly used level for daily EV charging. It requires a 208-240 volt electrical connection (either a plug like you might see for an electric dryer, or a hardwired connection) and can add roughly 25-35 miles per hour. This usually means an EV vehicle plugged in overnight would be fully charged in the morning.\\nDC Fast Charging is the 3rd type of charging available today. While it is the fastest type of charging available and can recharge an EV at a rate of 3-20 miles of range per minute, it is also the most expensive to install and maintain, and is the most demanding on the grid. It makes most sense for vehicles that are traveling long distances and is a good solution near highways.\\n\\nSo how fast is wireless charging? Today WiTricity’s 11 kW wireless charger is neck and neck with Level 2 charging with comparable speed and efficiency – but with the added ease and convenience of not having to deal with the plug.\\n\\nLooking forward, wireless charging can also provide the opportunity for “power snacking™.” EV owners today don’t typically take advantage of public plug-in charging unless they’re going to be parked for some time – it’s not worth the hassle. But when you can simply park to initiate charging, you can imagine a world where every stop in your daily routine is a top-off. Begin your morning with a full battery and keep it that way with snacks throughout the day. Wireless charging becomes your convenient “range extender” by making car charging easier … and more convenient.\\n\\nCordless Charging Station vs. EV Charging Station: What You Need to Know.\\n\\nThe majority of wired chargers are inaccessible for those who are disabled. From the weight of the cable to a lack of dropped curbs to unsuitable parking, public wired charging stations are difficult to access and difficult to use. Even in a private home, people with physical limitations may find the plug to be a challenge – or see the cord itself as a potential trip hazard. The ability to simply park and begin charging wirelessly eliminates any such struggles.\\n\\nWireless charging is safer, more convenient, and accessible.\\n\\nWiTricity’s EV Wireless Charging\\n\\nWiTricity is a complete, end-to-end system that provides industry-standard, interoperable wireless charging. This video shows how easy it is to charge an electric car – wirelessly. Making this all possible is our patented magnetic resonance technology, which is the foundation of our overall solution.

      "\t0.490\tHow Electric Vehicles are Disrupting the Grid - Kiewit News Room \"Whether it be cruising down the highway or parked at the grocery store, electric vehicles are becoming a common sight in and around urban areas in the U.S. Based on consumer demand and government mandates related to emissions reduction, electric vehicles for everyday transportation are increasingly gaining market share from fossil fueled vehicles.\\n\\nThe most notable barrier to increasing market share is “range anxiety.” U.S. drivers are accustomed to finding frequent gas fueling stations along both urban streets and rural routes. However, with a typical range of 200 miles per charge , nearly all urban electric vehicle (EV) drivers would have adequate energy for their daily driving needs with nightly charging at home. In addition, the deployment of urban charging stations at offices, parking garages, business and filling stations will further alleviate range anxiety. For rural and interstate routes, additional charging stations will be required to enable long distance travel. As this demand becomes a reality, consumers should expect to see electric fueling stations with multiple high-voltage charging stations that can fully charge a vehicle in about 30 minutes.\\n\\nTo realize the benefits of convenient EV transportation, we will have to meet the new demand these charging stations will introduce to the power grid. For example, a fast charging electric fueling station serving twenty cars simultaneously would draw approximately 2 MW, or enough to power 1,000 homes.3 Sustaining this new demand in addition to traditional power needs like air conditioners, refrigerators and lighting will stress the existing and largely antiquated distribution network.\\n\\nEncountering the EV challenge is just one example of why utilities are rapidly investing to modernize the distribution network with a focus on reliability. These current and planned investments well exceed those in the transmission market as preparations are underway for the convergence of increased need for distributed energy resources, smart infrastructure upgrades and electric vehicle charging.\\n\\nKiewit is serving the electric vehicle charging station infrastructure market through a unique partnership with LilyPad EV. This alliance melds Kiewit’s heritage of design and construction that dates back over 100 years and LilyPad EV’s hands-on experience deploying over 2,500 charging stations across the U.S. The duo will serve as a full solution provider offering planning, engineering, construction, procurement and installation of charging station ports for cities, electric utility companies, private fleets, and interstate corridors.\\n\\nAbout the authors:\\n\\nWith more than 20 years of experience in the power industry, Jon Gribble leads Kiewit’s Power Delivery group.

      "\t-3.922\tHow WiTricity Makes Charging Electric Cars Easier • WiTricity \"If you have an EV, you probably already count the experience of charging as the key drawback to what is otherwise a great car. And if you don’t own an EV, the hassle of charging may well be a key reason that is holding you back. Charging with a cord or cable is inconvenient – they can be heavy and bulky, trip hazards, vandalized, and located in sketchy or out-of-the-way places where you really don’t want to get out of the car. And that’s before you add arms full of kids or backpacks, rainy weather, or snowbanks. WiTricity makes charging electric cars easier: simply park and charge™.\\n\\nCharging Electric: The Evolution of Wireless Charging for EVs\\n\\nMany people are familiar with the idea of charging devices without wires from their experiences with things like electric toothbrushes, wireless headphones, and smartphones themselves. But wireless charging for electric vehicles uses a different technology with the key difference: WiTricity’s solution enables the transfer of power over distance. In other words, unlike your phone that needs to be in contact with the charging pad, and exactly aligned, EVs can charge with the WiTricity Halo® charging just by parking over it – across the air gap. And it does so just as quickly as the plug,\\n\\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge an Electric Car?\\n\\nThe length of time to charge an electric vehicle varies widely depending on a variety of factors, but the biggest variability depends on the type of charger being used. There are three key types of charging in use today.\\n\\nLevel 1 charging refers to the charger that comes with almost every electric vehicle. Also known as a “trickle” charger, it uses an ordinary 120-volt household outlet and adds between 3-5 miles of range per hour. If your car is routinely plugged in overnight, and your average travel per day is limited, this might be sufficient.\\nLevel 2 charging, significantly faster than Level 1 charging, is the most commonly used level for daily EV charging. It requires a 208-240 volt electrical connection (either a plug like you might see for an electric dryer, or a hardwired connection) and can add roughly 25-35 miles per hour. This usually means an EV vehicle plugged in overnight would be fully charged in the morning.\\nDC Fast Charging is the 3rd type of charging available today. While it is the fastest type of charging available and can recharge an EV at a rate of 3-20 miles of range per minute, it is also the most expensive to install and maintain, and is the most demanding on the grid. It makes most sense for vehicles that are traveling long distances and is a good solution near highways.\\n\\nSo how fast is wireless charging? Today WiTricity’s 11 kW wireless charger is neck and neck with Level 2 charging with comparable speed and efficiency – but with the added ease and convenience of not having to deal with the plug.\\n\\nLooking forward, wireless charging can also provide the opportunity for “power snacking™.” EV owners today don’t typically take advantage of public plug-in charging unless they’re going to be parked for some time – it’s not worth the hassle. But when you can simply park to initiate charging, you can imagine a world where every stop in your daily routine is a top-off. Begin your morning with a full battery and keep it that way with snacks throughout the day. Wireless charging becomes your convenient “range extender” by making car charging easier … and more convenient.\\n\\nCordless Charging Station vs. EV Charging Station: What You Need to Know.\\n\\nThe majority of wired chargers are inaccessible for those who are disabled. From the weight of the cable to a lack of dropped curbs to unsuitable parking, public wired charging stations are difficult to access and difficult to use. Even in a private home, people with physical limitations may find the plug to be a challenge – or see the cord itself as a potential trip hazard. The ability to simply park and begin charging wirelessly eliminates any such struggles.\\n\\nWireless charging is safer, more convenient, and accessible.\\n\\nWiTricity’s EV Wireless Charging\\n\\nWiTricity is a complete, end-to-end system that provides industry-standard, interoperable wireless charging. This video shows how easy it is to charge an electric car – wirelessly. Making this all possible is our patented magnetic resonance technology, which is the foundation of our overall solution.

      "\t-4.148\tAn electrifying future: Idaho National Laboratory’s role in White House efforts to make vehicle charging more accessible - INL \"INL News Release\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\nFeb. 22, 2023 \\n\\nNEWS MEDIA CONTACTS:\\nMichelle Goff, (208) 932-6581, Michelle.Goff@inl.gov\\nSarah Neumann, (208) 520-1651, sarah.neumann@inl.gov \\n\\nThe White House recently announced a plan to respond to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s call to make electric vehicle charging more accessible.   \\n\\nExperts across the federal government have identified charging as one of the biggest challenges to meet growing transportation electrification demand. New recommendations provided by the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation ensure that, as electric vehicle charging infrastructure is deployed nationwide, it will be safe and accessible.   \\n\\nIdaho National Laboratory’s John Smart, Jean Chu and Torrey Lyons served on the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation team that made these standards for safety and accessibility possible.   \\n\\nINL was asked to participate because of its vast expertise in both charging cybersecurity and charger siting. Over the past 20 years, the lab has collected extensive data on how to make EV chargers more reliable. This data has proven invaluable as the joint office works to deploy these minimum standards and requirements.  \\n\\n“This is the first time the federal government has established a national standard for electric vehicle charging infrastructure,” Smart said. “The joint office team pooled our technical expertise to help Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) establish regulations we perceive as necessary to help the industry grow and achieve a national charging network that is convenient, affordable, reliable and equitable. We also worked to ensure that these standards do not stifle innovation.”  \\n\\n“As we work with states to plan and implement a national charging network, we kept the principles of equity and environmental justice in mind,” said Lyons. “As evidenced by the Justice40 Initiative, a key Biden administration goal is to ensure that the benefits of the national charging network are enjoyed by those who have been historically left behind by the transportation system.”  \\n\\nIn addition to these minimum standards and requirements, the joint office worked with FHWA to issue another significant deliverable this week. This second effort provides clarification on how Buy America requirements apply to charging stations funded by the Department of Transportation. The document released by FHWA indicates that by July 2024, at least 55% of the contents needed to assemble new vehicle chargers must be manufactured in the United States.   \\n\\n“This guidance document will drive billions of dollars in investment throughout the nation,” Chu said. “Ideally, it will facilitate development of a domestic supply chain for electric vehicle charging equipment, positioning the United States as a continued leader in the world’s transition to electric transportation.”  \\n\\n“Serving on the joint office team has been a very rewarding experience,” said Smart. “Although we all come from different organizations and backgrounds, we have banded together as a single team for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We are thrilled to work with federal and state government agencies and the private sector to establish a national charging network that will make it possible for everyone to ride and drive electric.” \\n\\nAbout Idaho National Laboratory\\nBattelle Energy Alliance manages INL for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy.

    "### **Part 4: Discussion and Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of our semantic search system have been promising and align closely with our project goals. However, evaluating \"relevance\" remains inherently subjective and context-dependent. Without direct user interaction or labeled feedback data, the model’s performance cannot be significantly improved through traditional supervised learning. To address this, we are currently exploring the integration of reinforcement learning to iteratively enhance the quality of search results based on user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also in the process of integrating the model into our user interface. Our focus has been on ensuring that only meaningful and contextually appropriate results are displayed—improving both accuracy and presentation to deliver a polished user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key feature under development is the ability to apply filters based on relevance score, company name, and publication date. These filters will allow users to refine their search results and more easily locate specific content relevant to their interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable challenge we encountered was related to database integration. Initially, we used DynamoDB for data storage but later transitioned to Firebase due to compatibility concerns. We are currently experimenting with storing article content in CSV format for deployment, while using Firebase as a backup storage solution. This approach helps mitigate the high costs associated with continuous cloud storage access.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web application itself, though still in an early visual stage, was built using Flask and Django—both Python-based frameworks. This choice allows for seamless interaction between the model and the front end without relying on JavaScript. Once backend integration is finalized, we plan to deploy the web interface and complete the end-to-end user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, our primary goal is to implement reinforcement learning mechanisms that adapt based on user feedback and interaction. This will allow us to improve the model’s relevance scoring and continue refining the search experience for ASPIRE customers.\n"
