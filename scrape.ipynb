It\\u2019s been a minute since we last said hello and we\\u2019re sorry about that. You\\u2019ve all been keeping us quite busy over here at Hypercraft HQ and we just haven\\u2019t had a chance to fill you in. But since we\\u2019ve got big news to share, we skipped all our bathroom breaks, and cut every meeting down by :30 seconds to create time to write this up.\\u00a0\\n\\nIf you haven\\u2019t already heard, Hypercraft recently raised an exciting $6.5 million in seed funding. If you\\u2019re not familiar with funding, \\u201cseed\\u201d is an early stage investment round to bring money into the company to help us continue growing. Despite the name, there are no seeds involved, and therefore we have a lot of topsoil to return to Home Depot.\\u00a0\\n\\nAnyway, that initial seed round exceeded our goals and set us up for continued success as we finish up existing projects, start additional ones, kick things off with new customers, and develop all new products in the EV space.\\u00a0\\n\\nThe round was lead by RevRoad Capital, and we\\u2019ve included the full press release below, but here\\u2019s a great quote that echoes the excitement that Hypercraft and our partners are feeling right now:\\n\\n\\u201cHypercraft is a high-growth company that we\\u2019ve had our eye on for over a year now,\\u201d said David Mann, managing director at RevRoad Capital. \\u201cTheir leadership team combines innovative manufacturing experience and real-world business ingenuity to provide vehicle manufacturing a path to electrification. We\\u2019re thrilled to partner with Hypercraft, as it disrupts the rapidly growing EV sector in a variety of industries.\\u201d\\n\\nSo that\\u2019s that. There\\u2019s lots more updates to share.

No, it is in fact a warm, glowing passion for all things going fast, and doing it better than the next guy or gal. Yep, we love some good racing.\\u00a0\\n\\nSpeaking of doing it faster and better, have you heard of EVs? Not the type your neighbor uses to show off their vanity plate. No, we\\u2019re talking about the new era of neck-snapping, high performance electric racing vehicles that chiropractors everywhere are getting filthy rich off of. One-hundred percent torque from 0 RPM? Yes please.\\u00a0\\n\\nTake for example the Hypercraft-powered Scalar Performance SCR1. It took a maple syrup lubed toboggan ride down from Canada to debut at the SEMA Show last month. Now it\\u2019s kindly making its way down to Indianapolis for the REAL racers at PRI Show. If you saw it at SEMA, you\\u2019ll be seeing even more of it at PRI \\u2014 including a closer look at the EV drive system. If you didn\\u2019t see it at SEMA, then we\\u2019ll give you until December 8th to pack your bags and get down to Indy.\\u00a0\\n\\nWant to know more?

Your appetite is insatiable! No wonder you love National Donut Day. Ok, well after you\\u2019ve done the North Hall, take a short walk over to Central Hall to find Hypercraft featured as a Top 5 finalist in the SEMA Launchpad section of the show. Our innovative and modular HyperPack EV batteries caught the judges\\u2019 attention in this year\\u2019s competition and we\\u2019re hoping to take home the top prize.

Our complete electric propulsion systems for both builders and individual buyers are set to change the game.\\n\\nWe just got back from an incredible week in beautiful Miami where we exhibited our complete electric propulsion systems for the entire marine industry. We setup shop near other EV companies bringing electrification to the water, as well as current gas and oil stalwarts striving to squeeze every last drop of performance out of internal combustion \\u2014 and we wouldn\\u2019t want to be anywhere else. We come from gas but look to the future of electrification, and feel at home around all these great companies and people.\\n\\nOther amazing brands are already working hard to deliver electric propulsion to the water. We\\u2019re excited to add our complete systems to the mix to help boat builders and individuals wanting to achieve the same levels of innovation. We had a booth in both the Charged Electric Pavilion, and in the accessory manufacturer area of the Progressive Boat Show Experience in Pride Park.\\n\\nOver the five days of the show, we talked one-on-one with hundreds of excited individuals looking to re-power their dirty, loud, and incredibly thirsty internal combustion-powered boats. They were excited about the powerful and incredibly efficient electric alternatives we have available and that we\\u2019re already providing to the powersports and racing industries. We also met with many incredibly talented and creative boat builders specializing in everything from small launches all the way up to amphibious cars and multi-million dollar yacht tenders.\\n\\nAfter just he first day, it was abundantly clear that marine is ready for the electric revolution. Despite so many use cases, boat sizes, power needs, and range requirements, electric propulsion has the power and potential to check all the required boxes \\u2014 all while having incredible longevity, and a level of efficiency that internal combustion can\\u2019t touch. From sailboats to sea-worthy speed boats, we had eager customers interested in ever level of our Genesis Series of propulsion systems.\\n\\nWe saw monstrous outboard V12s, beastly supercharged ski boat motors, and large, lavishly appointed craft that put even our own homes to shame. Were we jealous? You better be believe it. But more than jealous, we were excited by the energy we experienced surrounding the electrification of marine. Boaters are ready, willing, and wanting the benefits of EV, and we\\u2019re fired up to deliver on those expectations.\\n\\nUntil then, we\\u2019ll be further perfecting our Genesis line of complete electric propulsion systems, and working on getting fit and tan like the Miami locals for next year\\u2019s boat show. A little bit of innovation and a lot fewer carbs can go a long way.

Now we love big power as much as anyone, but simply comparing the output numbers of an ICE motor and an electric motor can result in spending more money on an electric motor that far exceeds your needs.\\n\\nHow are electric motors different?\\nElectric motors produce a completely different power curve than internal combustion engines. Because almost all of their torque is immediately available at 0 RPM, they provide more push, or thrust, at equal horsepower ratings and gearing, and they have much more power throughout the RPM range. For performance enthusiasts, this is great news.\\n\\nWhat is HP?\\nHorsepower is the ability of an engine or motor to do work. Work is defined as force applied over a distance for a unit of time. Horsepower for an engine or motor is also defined as torque times RPM (divided by a conversion constant of 5252.) An internal combustion engine will likely only produce the advertised, or maximum, HP at a specific RPM. The same holds true for its torque characteristics.\\n\\nWhat does it mean?\\u00a0\\nAn electric motor will produce nearly 100% of its maximum torque at 0 RPM, and its torque curve will be relatively flat over most of its full RPM range. So the usable power, or horsepower,\\u00a0will be available across almost all of the electric motor\\u2019s RPM range. Because electric motors provide at times up to 75% more power than internal combustion engines at the same horsepower rating, it\\u2019s common to mistakenly oversize your\\u00a0motor when choosing and electric equivalent.\\n\\nThe science behind eHP.\\nUsing a calculation of area under the curve for an ICE and electric motor torque curve, we can calculate the available performance for each motor. As seen in the example graph below, the electric motor has 66% more area (power) available to it. This means that an electric motor can do the work of an ICE that has 66% more horsepower.\\n\\nGraph shows the torque curve of an ICE vs an electric motor with essentially the same HP. The space below the curve represents the actual power/performance of each motor. The electric motor not only has a higher peak torque, but maintains a higher torque throughout most of the RPM range.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s an example:\\n\\nInternal Combustion Engine (ICE): GM 5.3 Liter V8\\nPeak HP \\u2013 345\\nPeak Torque \\u2013 400 lb-ft\\n\\nElectric Motor: Dana MV800\\nPeak HP \\u2013 330hp\\nPeak Torque \\u2013 592 lb-ft\\neHP \\u2013 496\\n\\nOrder with confidence.\\nIf you need help choosing the right motor for your application, eHP can help put things in perspective.
